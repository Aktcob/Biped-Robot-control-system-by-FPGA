INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [c:/Users/lenovo/Desktop/comeon/blue.srcs/sources_1/ip/clk_wiz_0/clk_wiz_0.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/state_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/state_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

CRITICAL WARNING: [Vivado 12-1411] Cannot set LOC property of ports, Instance csb/instance_name/inst/clkin1_ibufg can not be placed in INBUF_EN of site IOB_X0Y26 because the bel is occupied by blue/instance_name/inst/clkin1_ibufg. This could be caused by bel constraint conflict [C:/Users/lenovo/Desktop/comeon/blue.srcs/constrs_1/new/state.xdc:1]
Resolution: Verify the location constraints for differential ports are correctly specified in your constraints. The Site type should be of form: IO_LxxP for P-side, and IO_LxxN for N-side (Neg Diff Pair)

WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/lenovo/Desktop/comeon/blue.srcs/constrs_1/new/state.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/state_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
